# SNIST_Campus_Navigator

Implemented a C++ program for SNIST campus
navigation using Graph data strucute and
Dijkstra's algorithm, allowing users to find
the shortest path and distance between
locations within the campus.

The program provides an interactive menu
and displays the results for specified
source and destination blocks, enhancing
the navigation and convenience.
