# Campus_Navigator

Implemented a C++ program for campus
navigation using Graph data strucute and
Dijkstra's algorithm, allowing users to find
the shortest path and distance between
locations within a campus.

The program provides an interactive menu
and displays the results for specified
source and destination blocks, enhancing
the navigation and convenience.
